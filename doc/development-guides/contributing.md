##Contributing Code

###Fork The Code

> we assume you already have a clone of  `https://github.com/opencrowbar/core`

  1. create a personal fork of the `https://github.com/opencrowbar/core`
    1. Fork the code if you want to be able to submit changes
    1. rename your fork in Github to something like 'crowbar-core' to make it easier to track.  We'll assume that you did that in these directions
    1. remember to update your public SSH key to github
  1. setup your git identity (one time only)
    1. `git config --global user.name "user.name"`
    1. `git config --global user.email "email.address"`
  1. add a personal remote: `git remote add personal `https://github.com/[yourgitnamehere]/[crowbar-core]`
  1. you can check your remotes using `git remote -v`
  2. get the latest code from your repo `git fetch personal`

##To create a pull request

  1. make your change and commit it: `git commit -a -m "I cut and pasted this"`
  1. get the latest code from origin: `git fetch`
  1. sync your code into the trunk: `git rebase`
     1. you may have to merge changes using `git add [file]= and =git rebase --continue--`

##Edit Documentation

You do NOT need a local clone to update docs!  You can edit them right from your fork on Github.  Just make the changes and then create a pull request.  

We love DOCS changes.
